Shettima to the public and its various organs as the running mate of its 2023 presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at a well-attended ceremony,&rdquo; Mr Onanuga said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He added that at the unveiling, Messrs Tinubu and Shettima, and former Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti and Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi and the party&rsquo;s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, in their speeches, addressed fundamental issues of nation building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, he said, was the focus of the APC and its candidates with a view to ensuring a progressive and prosperous nation where all citizens could find joy and fulfilment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr Onanuga explained that the event was an open affair, which allowed members of the public to attend, &rdquo;including the clergymen and others now being derided by hirelings of the opposition&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We want to say that those clergymen were not fake, not mechanics or yam sellers as the purveyors of hatred have made Nigerians to believe in the social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are not big names in Christendom yet, they are gradually building up their missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are Church leaders who genuinely believe that Nigerians must eschew politics of hatred and religious bigotry and rather embrace politics of peace and nation building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We therefore deplore the hysterical twisting of the presence of these men and women in cassocks and the false accusation against our candidates, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Sen.

Los Rojiblancos have no space in their salary cap and they can&#39;t meet&nbsp;<strong>Manchester United</strong>&#39;s demands.</p>\n\n<p>However, they are aware that their revenue would skyrocket due to the commercial impact a potential&nbsp;<strong>Ronaldo&nbsp;</strong>arrival would make.</p>\n\n<h2>A couple of strikers or two important players must leave</h2>\n\n<p>To make room for&nbsp;<strong>Ronaldo</strong>, at least two players would have to leave the club. One would be&nbsp;<strong>Alvaro Morata&nbsp;</strong>and the other could be a midfielder such as&nbsp;<strong>Saul Niguez&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Lemar</strong>.</p>\n\n<h1><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\"https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/1972cdcd6c3b30476816b1828d8e7bf9/resize/990/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2022/07/23/16585954971623.jpg\" style=\\\"float:right; height:50%; width:50%\\\" /></h1>\n\n<h2>R7 would have to lower his salary, and is willing to</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Atletico&nbsp;</strong>can&#39;t afford to cover his salary but the Portuguese star would be willing to lower his wages in order to play in the Champions League next season.</p>\n\n<h2>Want to play in the major European competition</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Ronaldo</strong>&#39;s desire is to play Champions League and that&#39;s why he has approached clubs such as&nbsp;<strong>Chelsea&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Bayern Munich</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>He wants to be in a team who will compete for the trophy and believes that&nbsp;<strong>Atletico&nbsp;</strong>are among the candidates.</p>\n\n<h2>Out of options beyond Atletico</h2>\n\n<p>Los Rojiablancos were one of&nbsp;<strong>Ronaldo</strong>&#39;s last options. However, for the time being there is not much interest for the&nbsp;<strong>Manchester United&nbsp;</strong>forward and his agent&nbsp;<strong>Jorge Mendes&nbsp;</strong>offered him to&nbsp;<strong>Atletico</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Pushed to stay in Manchester</h2>\n\n<p>Some people close to the Portuguese star have advised him against departing&nbsp;<strong>Manchester United</strong>. They believe that he can help the team return to their glory days.</p>\n\n<h2>Considered a Real Madrid legend</h2>\n\n<p>A move to&nbsp;<strong>Atletico&nbsp;</strong>could be a blow for&nbsp;<strong>Real Madrid&nbsp;</strong>fans, who will see the club&#39;s all-time leading scorer join their local rivals. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>Ronaldo&nbsp;</strong>would be delighted to return to the Spanish capital.</p>\n\n<h2>Atletico fans&#39; reception</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Ronaldo&nbsp;</strong>was public enemy number one for the&nbsp;<strong>Atletico&nbsp;</strong>fans and even when he was at&nbsp;<strong>Juventus</strong>, he had altercations with supporters at the Metropolitano.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '1', '2022-07-25 15:17:29');
